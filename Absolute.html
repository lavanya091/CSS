    <p>IS THIS YOU?
Couldn’t stand seeing yourself as a failure in front of your parents<br>
Avoiding your friends as they would boast about their new jobs<br>
Fearing you will end in a poorly-paid graduate job that you’ll never like<br>
Wondering how you will compete in the off-campus fresher recruitment race<br>
Getting angry when your relatives show up<br>
Constantly plagued by the question, “What will I do next?”<br>
Because..<br>
You didn’t get placed in the campus.<br>
Your college doesn’t offer campus recruitment.<br>
You’re being rejected in off-campus interviews.<Br>
You want to become a software engineer, but you’re not a computer science graduate.<br>
You’re clueless how to get a well-paying IT job off campus.<br>
If so, it’s time you put an end to your career worries and sleepless nights. Once and forever.<br>
